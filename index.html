        <p>Jason Mitrano is well-rounded, reliable and always willing to learn new skills and abilities.
            He graduated from Northeastern University in 2019 with a B.S. in Communications and a Music minor, and spent
            multiple years during and after graduation working in public relations with clients ranging from B2B
            AI and machine learning providers to independent musicians. He has an intermediate level background in
            Python programming with some background in HTML and CSS as well, and is planning to learn C# once he has
            mastered Python. In his spare time, Jason likes to write and record music (or just noodle on the guitar),
            explore new places (both in person and on Google Maps), write useful (or sometimes useless) computer
            programs and read fiction and nonfiction books. He is also currently learning how to create pixel art and
            hopes to create a 2D pixel-based video game in the future. </p>
